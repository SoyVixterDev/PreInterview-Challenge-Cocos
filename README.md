# PreInterview-Challenge-Cocos

## Introduction
For this challenge I decided to make a simple side-view player controller similar to Beat-Em-Up! games, the player can control a character with WASD and move within a bridge and collect apples that rain from above, I created all assets by hand using the pixelart software Aseprite.

## Cocos Creator
I had no prior experience with either Cocos Creator or the Typescript language, but I was able to adapt quickly to the environment because the engine is similar to other engines I've used in the past such as Unity or Godot, and Typescript is similar to Javascript, which I've also used in the past.

## Resources
I mostly tried to learn everything I used by experimentation, and I think Cocos is intuitive enough for me to have been able to do most of the project without a lot of external resources. 
For other learning material and consultation I had the Cocos Forums and Documentation always open, I tried to use ChatGPT eventually but noticed that GPT wasn't very familiar with Cocos, and the responses weren't really useful, so I continued using the documentation for most of the project.
The sprites and backgrounds were all designed and drawn by myself specifically for this project.

## Coding & Intentions
My main focus during the challenge was to get a hold of the Cocos engine and Typescript in the context of game development, so apart from the original instructions I added a couple of features that I think are essential to game development, including animation, collision detection, transform manipulation, etc. Additionally I experimented with generating a build of the game, which is included in this repo.

Another small detail I added is pixel snapping. I'm used to working with pixelart, being my artstyle of choice for most games, and I'm aware that uneven pixels and uneven resolutions cause the art to look cheap and unpolished, so I always aim to make the pixelart look and act within the limitations of their resolution, to sell the quality and consistency.

## Conclusion
The resulting game is a very simple and barebones demo to get the basics of the engine and language down, I haven't gotten into other parts of the engine such as 3D, Shaders, post processing, etc; but from what I've read it won't be that different to other engines so I would probably also adapt easily.

After this task I was able to get some familiarization with Cocos and Typescript, my level with this engine wouldn't be as great as my level with Unity for example, because of the many years of experience I have in that platform, but I can tell that I would be able to improve in this framework fast and my knowledge from other game engines are useful because of the similarities it has with other industry standard engines.
